# Markov Chain Text Generator

A program to generate random text using the Markov Chain algorithm. Based on
*The Practice of Programming* (Kernighan & Pike, 1999).

    python markov.py | fmt

will read `input.txt` and produce a paragraph's worth of random text. The
`input.txt` here is the text of *Pride and Prejudice* from Project Gutenberg
(https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt), but any plain text file
will work.
